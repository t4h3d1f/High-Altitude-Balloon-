High altitude balloon project

Shooting for 21,430 meters, or just over 70,000 feet. According to highaltitudescience.com, with a payload of 5.44 kg and a balloon of 600g, we need 6.25 m^3 of He to reach our desired altitude.

-53 C and 5 pa are expected conditions for said flight. If said flight takes 285.9 minutes, that's 4.765 hours. Assuming linear velocity, the balloon goes 1.25 m/s.
